# **Chapter 1** : **The ABC Of Programming**

### **A:** What is a script and how do I creat one? .

### **B:** How do computers fit in with the world around them? .

### **C:** How do I write a script for a web page? .

---------------------------
**Script** : define as a series of information that a computer can follow to achieve a goal.

* **Note#1:** script can different sections of the code in response to the situation around them .

* this an an example of a script I write it today in Lab04 :

```
<script>
    alert('Hello Iam Awon Khrais');
    /*
       I live in Irbid,Idoun .
       I am graduated before 2 years from Yarmouk universit from civil engineer department.
       And now I am learning to as softwer developer.
    */
alert('I was born in:'+1996);

var X = 25;
alert(X+25);

var MyGithupUsername='Githup account:awonkhrais';
document.write(MyGithupUsername);

var x=  prompt('enter you age','25');

alert(x/2);

if(x<0) {
    alert('you input a negative value')
}
    else{
        alert('You input a positive value');
    }
if(x==25)
{
    alert(25);
}

</script>
```
learning any new language, you need
to get to grips with the:

• Vocabulary: The words that computers understand.

• Syntax: How you put those words together to create instructions computers can follow .

* **Note#2:** To approach writing a script, break down your goal into a series of tasks and then work out each step needed to complete that task (a flowchart can help).

# **Expressions & Operators:**

* An expression evaluates into (results in) a single value. Broadly speaking ,there are two types of expressions :

1. EXPRESSIONS THAT JUST ASSIGN A VALUE TO A VARIABLE :
```
var color = 'White';
```
2. EXPRESSIONS THAT USE TWO OR MORE VALUES TO RETURN A SINGLE VALUE :
```
var area = 3*2;
```
* Expressions rely on things called operators; they allow programmers to create a single value from one or more 
values.

# **Functions:**
* Functions let you group a series of statements together to perform a specific task.
