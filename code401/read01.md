## Beginners Guide to Big O

* Big O Notation: describes performance of algorithm - specfially run time.

O(1) : will always execute in the same time/space

O(N) : Describes an algorithm whose performance will grow linearly and in direct proportion to the size of the input data set

0(N^2) : directly proportional to the square of its input size

0(2^N) : growth doubles with each data input

0(log N) : targets median, compares to target value, if higher/lower will take median up upper/lower limit.
