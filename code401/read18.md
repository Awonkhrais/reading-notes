# Cryptography

## Encryption

The process of making text secret is call Encryption.
Ceasar cipher, the shift cipher, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. He would shift the letters in the alphabet by 3 spaces.
The Ceasar cipher is one example of a larger class of techniques called Substitution ciphers.
It is a substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
Shift the alphabet 6 positions and "SECRET MEETING AT THE PALACE" now becomes "YKIXKZ SKKZOTM GZ ZNK VGRGIK"
Permutation Ciphers: columnar transposition cipher - take a messaage and put letter into a grid, read the letter from a different order from bottom left to top.
The knew letter ordering called permutation is the new message. ORdering direction and the grid size serves as the key.


## Decrypting

The processs of reversing encrypted text is call decryption.
messagers has to know the algorithm and the amount to shift for them to decode the message.
