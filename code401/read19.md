# Automation

Automation is the creation and application of technologies to produce and deliver goods and services with minimal human intervention. The implementation of automation technologies, techniques and processes improve the efficiency, reliability, and/or speed of many tasks that were previously performed by humans.

Regular Expressions, often shortened as regex, are a sequence of characters used to check whether a pattern exists in a given text (string) or not.

re : Python library that supports regular expressions

Special characters are characters that do not match themselves as seen but have a special meaning when used in a regular expression.

`.` - A period. Matches any single character except the newline character.

`^` - A caret. Matches the start of the string.

`$` - Matches the end of string.

`[abc]` - Matches a or b or c.

`[a-zA-Z0-9]` - Matches any letter from (a to z) or (A to Z) or (0 to 9).

`[^]` all the characters that are not in the set will be matched.

`\ - Backslash.` :

* If the character following the backslash is a recognized escape character, then the special meaning of the term is taken

* Else if the character following the \ is not a recognized escape character, then the \ is treated like any other character and passed through .

* \ can be used in front of all the metacharacters to remove their special meaning
