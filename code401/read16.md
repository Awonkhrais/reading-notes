# Machine Learning

* Machine Learning is not about algorithms, its a comprehensive approach to solving problems.

* Machine Learning is the practice of teaching computers how to learn patterns from data, often for making decisions or predictions.

## Key Terminology

* Model - a set of patterns learned from data.

* Algorithm - a specific ML process used to train a model.

* Training data - the dataset from which the algorithm learns the model.

* Test data - a new dataset for reliably evaluting model performance.

* Features - Variables (columns) in the dataeslt used to train the model.

* Target variable - a specific variagble you're trying to predict.

* Observations- Data points (rows) in the dataset.

## Machine Learning Tasks

* a task is a specific objective for your algorithms.
* Algorithms can be swapped in and out, as long as you pick the right task.
* Always try multiple algorithms because you most likely won't know which one will perform best for your dataset.

## 3 Elements of Great Machine Learning

1. Human guidance plays a huge role.
2. the quality of your data
3. Do not overfit. An overfit model has "memorized" the noise in the training set, instead of learning the true uderlying patterns.
