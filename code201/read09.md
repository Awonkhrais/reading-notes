# **Chapter 7: HTML Forms**

The best known form on the web is probably the search box that sits right in the middle of Googleâ€™s homepage.

In addition to enabling users to search, forms also allow users to perform other functions online. You will see forms when registering as a member of a website, when shopping online, and when signing up for newsletters or mailing lists.

# **Chapter 14 :Lists, Tables & Forms**

There are several CSS properties that were created to work with specific types ofHTML elements.

### Lists



1. `list-syle-type` : this property aloows you to control the shape or style of a bullet point.

- Unordered List (ul) :
  

- ordered List (ol) :

  - decimal (1 2 3 4 5)

  - decimal-leading-zero (01 02 03)

  - lower-alpha (a b c)

  - Upper-alpha (A B C)

  - Lower-romain (i. ii. iii.)

  - Upper-romain (I. II. III.)

2. `list-style-image` : You can specify an image to act as a bullet point using the list-style-image property.

```css
ul {
  list-style-image: url("images/star.png");
}
li {
  margin: 10px 0px 0px 0px;
}
```

3. `list-style-position` : Lists are indented into the page by default and the list-style-position property indicates whether the marker should appear on the inside or the outside of the box containing the main points.


## Forms

### Aligning from controls.

Labels for form elements are often different lengths, which means that the form controls will not appear in a straight line. This is demonstrated in the example on the right (without CSS applied to the form controls).

DIFFERENT EVENT TYPES 
Here is a selection of the events that occur in the browser while you are browsing the web. Any of these events can be used to trigger a function in your JavaScript code. 
UIEVENTS Occur when a user interacts with the browser's user interface (UI) rather than the web page 

* Events are the browser's way of indicating when something has happened (such as when a page has finished loading or a button has been clicked). 
* Binding is the process of stating which event you are waiting to happen, and which element you are waiting for that event to happen upon. 
* When an event occurs on an element, it can trigger a JavaScript function.
* When this function then changes the web page in some way, it feels interactive because it has responded to the user. 
* You can use event delegation to monitor for events that happen on all of the children of an element. 
* The most commonly used events are W3C DOM events, although there are others in the HTMLS specification as well as browser-specific events.
