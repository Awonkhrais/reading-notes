# **Comparison and logical operators**

* The == tool: this tools gives me true if I compare between things with the same datatype like numbers if they were equal gives me true or the strings if they are the same it will give me true.
* The != tool: this one gives me true when things are wrong it is call unequal so when I write 1 != 2 it will give me true.
* The === tool:this tool will give me true when the data type and the value are both equal like ‘3’ === ‘3’ is true because they have the same value and datatype.
* The !== tool=this tool gives me true when the datatype and the value are not the same it like unequal but it checks the datatype and the value.
* The <= tool:this allows me to compare between two values if the the value on the left is equal or smaller than the value on the right.
* The >= tool:this allows me compare between two numbers to check if the number on the left is bigger or equal the number on the right.

## We can use logical operaitors to compare between comparsion operatiors (so we have three logical operaitors):
![logical operators](https://www.devopsschool.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JavaScript-Logical-Operator.png)

* AND: will be represinted by this symbol && and if we compare between two results and one of them is false the AND resulte will be false.
* OR: if we copmare between tow results and onr of them is true the OR resulte will be true.
* NOT: will be represinted by this symbol ! and when we use it the boolean value will change so when we use it when the sentens is true it changes it to false.

# **For and While loops**

We use the logical operaitors in loops to make sure that the user has done the exact thing I want him to do like for and while.

* For loop syntax :

* While loop syntax :

* Do- While loop syntax :
