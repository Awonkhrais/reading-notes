# Readings: REST

## How I explained REST to my brother

### Who is Roy Fielding? 
Roy Fielding is one of some people that collaberated and created the first web server. He dedicated a lot of his time researching why the web does what it does. 
### Why donâ€™t the techniques that we use today work well when we need to be able to talk to all of the machines in the world? 
Simply because it was not designed to do so. When created, the main purpose and goal was to be able to reach out to any machine - and not to talk to many. 
### What is the HTTP protocol that Fielding and his friends created? 
Hypertext Trasfer Protocol is a protocol that allows a computer to communicate with another computer to pull information from it.
### What does a GET do? 
GET is in charge of getting the resource that is needed from a server - in other words GET will retrieve what is requested. 
### What does a POST do? 
POST is used to push information to make a resource. 
### What does PUT do? 
PUT is similar to POST where you send data to the server to update or change it, however PUT will return the same thing if you call it multiple times. 
### What does PATCH do? 
This gives intructions on how to change or modify a resource.
