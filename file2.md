## ***Reminder my self***
This part I put it here to give my self a continuous motiviations :

1. **Challenges**
* The best way to beat the odds is to break through.
* Do not challenge a person who has nothing to lose.
* When we lose hope in changing reality, the biggest challenge is our ability to change ourselves.

2.**Obstacles**

* The big obstacle to reaching happiness is great happiness waiting for us.
* The most solid obstacle in the world is the obstacle between one person’s thinking and another’s thinking.

3.**Effort**

* A life that we do not undergo research and study is not worth living.
* By working hard eight hours a day, you can someday become a manager and work an hour a day.
