So I will talk here about something called **Growth Mindset:**

To briefly sum up the findings,individuals who believe their talents can be developed (through hard work, good strategies, and input from others) have a growth mindset. They tend to achieve more than those with a more fixed mindset (those who believe their talents are innate gifts). This is because they worry less about looking smart and they put more energy into learning.

In contrast, people at primarily fixed-mindset companies report more of only one thing: cheating and deception among employees, presumably to gain an advantage in the talent race.

## ***Reminder my self***
This part I put it here to give my self a continuous motiviations :

1. **Challenges**
* The best way to beat the odds is to break through.
* Do not challenge a person who has nothing to lose.
* When we lose hope in changing reality, the biggest challenge is our ability to change ourselves.

2.**Obstacles**

* The big obstacle to reaching happiness is great happiness waiting for us.
* The most solid obstacle in the world is the obstacle between one person’s thinking and another’s thinking.

3.**Effort**

* A life that we do not undergo research and study is not worth living.
* By working hard eight hours a day, you can someday become a manager and work an hour a day.
