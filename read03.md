* **Note#1** : we should always updated the site content constantly.

## **Site Map:** Sitemaps may be addressed to users or to software. Many sites have user-visible sitemaps which present a systematic view, typically hierarchical, of the site,so we can use a technique help us to divide the page through the map called ***card sorting***.

* So the first steb to desgin the website do something called **wireframe**



* this is an example of wireframe I did it today [my wireframe](https://awonkhrais.github.io/wireframe/) ,so through the lab I thinked to creat a site for electronic products.

* Three point we should take care about its when we make a wireframe:
1. Content
2. Prioritizing
3. Organizing

* **Note#2:** We must also interst about the (Visual hierarchy) this help the vistors to find the goal faster.

* **Note#3** We also good to care about design navigation like a **Concise**,**Clear** and **Selective**.

* In general HTML pages are text documents,to learn HTML you need to know what tags(characters that sit inside angled
brackets) are available for you to use.

# **Chapter 17** : **HTML5 LAYOUT**
*So here we will use **div** element we use this tag to elements to group together related elements on the page.

We have many tags we can use it like : **header**,**footer**,**nav**,**articles**,**aside** and **section**,etc...

* **Note:** Older browsers that do not
know the new HTML5 elements
will automatically treat them as
inline elements. Therefore, to
help older browsers, you should
include the line of CSS on the
left which states which new
elements should be rendered as
block-level elements.

# **Chapter 8** : **Extra Markup**

* The Evolution of HTML >>> HTML 4 >>> XHTML 1.0 >>> HTML5

* **Note:** ***DOCTYPEs*** should begin with th page and these ***DOCTYPEs*** different from version to other .
